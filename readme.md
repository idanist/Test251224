# ReadME for Test 25/12/2024:

    Welcome to my code! Here you can find different methonds to recieve information from a database about diamonds.

    Please take notice to a few points of emphasis: 

    * All the functions can be found in external file: 'functions.py' so make sure you copy it as well!
      'app.py' won't work without it!

    * The code uses data from cvs file 'data.csv', so please make sure you name your diamond database the same, or that you change the 'DATA_FILE' in the code (row 4) to the name you prefer.

    * The code uses ENUM, so please make sure you copy line 2, where ENUM is imported.
    * There is a mutual use between the code 'app.py' and the external function code 'functions.py' so please make sure you import them in each other, you can copy line 1 from both codes where I did that for you.

HOPE YOU LIKE IT :)
